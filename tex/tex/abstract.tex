This paper proposes a new data structure \emph{multiset-trie} that is designed for storing and efficiently processing a set of multisets. Moreover, multiset-trie can operate on a set of sets without efficiency loss.
%
The multiset-trie is a search tree with properties similar to those of a trie. It implements all standard search tree operations together with the multiset containment operations such as sub-multiset and super-multiset. Suppose we have a set of multisets $S$ and a multiset $X$. The multiset containment operations retrieve multisets from $S$ that are either sub-multisets or super-multisets of $X$. 

We present the mathematical analysis of a multiset-trie that gives the time complexity of the algorithms and the space complexity of the data structure. Further, the empirical analysis of the data structure is implemented in a series of experiments. The experiments illuminate the time complexity space of the multiset containment operations.
%Finally, the comparison of the multiset-trie with the inverted index shows that the multiset-trie outperforms the inverted index by up to 4 orders of magnitude.
