Section 1

-- 1st paragraph: a very general observation about the data processing...
I will try first to get the complete idea about the intro...

-- 2nd paragraph: I would merge 2nd and 3rd paragraphs. It is easier to describe concrete things.

-- 3rd paragraph: I would separate the description (comments on) of inv file and other structures. 
Most papers say that inv file has the capabilities to answer submset and supmset queries.
The query is not "direct" but uses some operations... but anyway.

-- general comment: references must be stated in the description of the related approaches. 
Maybe, if you have some, the reference or two could be added to 1st and 2nd paragraph.

-- so, the first 3 paragraps are about the *problem* that we deal with... 

      * Firstly, I would explicitely and clearly state the problem definition. 
        Perhaps in the 1st paragraph. 

      * Then you can lean on this description and present the details, problems, environment, etc. and 

      * finally, the existing approaches and their drawbacks.

-- 4th paragraph: "In this paper we propose a data structure multiset-trie that is designed 
for storage and processing of multisets." Isn't it a set of multisets?

-- I would merge paragraphs 4, 5 and 6. Paragraphs 5 and 6 are well written; I would just correct 
few sentences. I would merge paragraph 4 with the 5 and 6.

-- The explicit statetement of the contributions needs to be presented. I suggest that you prepare 
the material and then I can re-write the complete introduction (you can then continue at 
Related work). 

-- I would shorten the announcement of sections. 

Section 5

-- homepage for the code of mstrie could be created to provide the source to reviewers.
It is quite usual that the data is also provided.

-- English needs to be corrected in the second paragraph. Can I correct ENglish directly?

-- Are you sure that we are reading micro seconds? (10^-6 seconds)

-- experiments tables. The scale-up is 1000-10000... can you justify this? Why are exact queries so fast 
in comparison to inv-file? 

-- Before the tables are presented the parameters should be described. I suspect n=multiplicity. 

-- "Interestingly, the multiplicity also affects the time of processing, however, this happens passively."
Can you explain this? Again, English should be corrected. I suggest that I go once through the text and 
maybe you check it then again.

-- last paragraph in the section should perhaps include more convenient justification. I would 
stress that in existance tests we need to find one example! Is it hard to mention how many nodes have 
been visited?

General comments:

-- I think that maybe the implementation of the inverted files could be described so that the reader
sees it (plus the code).

-- It came to my mind about the larger sigma. Do we have an experiment that includes larger sigmas? 
Then reader should be satisfied by that...
